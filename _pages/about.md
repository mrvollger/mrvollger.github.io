## The Vollger Lab

The Vollger lab will be coming to the Department of Human Genetics at University of Utah January 1st 2026! New website coming soon. Positions available! Please reach out to me if you are interested in joining the lab.

## My history

I was born in 1992 in Carson City, Nevada, where I developed a love for the high desert and the Sierra Nevada mountains. After a brief period in Elko, Nevada, my family relocated to Eureka, California, where I discovered a new love for the Pacific Ocean and the Redwoods.

My academic journey began at College of the Redwoods where I found dedicated professors who fueled my passion for learning. This early college experience proved invaluable as I completed Associate of Arts degrees in math and science. Following this I attended Princeton University and in 2015 I graduated with a B.S.E. in computer science and a minor in quantitative and computational biology. During my time at Princeton, I worked in the lab of Alison Gammie improving the reference genome for the yeast strain W303. In 2016, I joined the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington in pursuit of a PhD, ultimately joining the lab of Evan E. Eichler to study the sequence and assembly of segmental duplications in humans and nonhuman primates. I continued my work in the Eichler lab as a postdoctoral fellow while making contributions to the T2T and HPRC. Currently, I am in Andrew Stergachis' [lab](https://stergachislab.org/) at the University of Washington deepening my understanding of gene regulation and human disease.
