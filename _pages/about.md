## My history

In 2015 I graduated from Princeton with B.S.E. in computer science and a minor in quantitative and computational biology. During my time at Princeton, I worked in the lab of Alison Gammie improving the reference genome for the yeast strain W303. In 2016 I joined the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington in pursuit of a PhD, ultimately joining the lab of Evan E. Eichler to study the sequence and assembly of segmental duplications in humans and nonhuman primates. I am continued my work in the Eichler lab as a postdoctoral fellow while making contributions to the T2T and HPRC. Currently, I am in Andrew Stergachis's [lab](https://stergachislab.org/) at the University of Washington.
