## Tools

- Segemntal Duplication Assembler ([SDA](https://mrvollger.github.io/SDA/)) is for identifying and resolving collapsed SDs.

- [Rustybam](https://mrvollger.github.io/rustybam/) is a toolkit for processing alignments. Works well with SafFire.

- [Rhodonite](https://github.com/mrvollger/Rhodonite) is a modular workflow for sequence masking and annotation.
