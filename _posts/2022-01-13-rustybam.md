    | rb break-paf --max-size 100 `#breaks the alignment into smaller pieces on indels of 100 bases or more` \
    | rb orient `#orients each contig so that the majority of bases are forward aligned` \
    | rb liftover --bed <(printf "chr22\t12000000\t13000000\n") `#subsets and trims the alignment to 1 Mbp of chr22.` \
