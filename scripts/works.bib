  abstract = {Resolving the molecular basis of a Mendelian condition (MC)
              remains challenging owing to the diverse mechanisms by which
              genetic variants cause disease. To address this, we developed a
              synchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome, and
              transcriptome sequencing approach, which enables accurate
              single-nucleotide, insertion-deletion, and structural variant
              calling and diploid de novo genome assembly, and permits the
              simultaneous elucidation of haplotype-resolved CpG methylation,
              chromatin accessibility, and full-length transcript information
              in a single long-read sequencing run. Application of this
              approach to an Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) participant
              with a chromosome X;13 balanced translocation of uncertain
              significance revealed that this translocation disrupted the
              functioning of four separate genes ( NBEA , PDK3 , MAB21L1 , and
              RB1 ) previously associated with single-gene MCs. Notably, the
              function of each gene was disrupted via a distinct mechanism that
              required integration of the four `omes' to resolve. These
              included nonsense-mediated decay, fusion transcript formation,
              enhancer adoption, transcriptional readthrough silencing, and
              inappropriate X chromosome inactivation of autosomal genes.
              Overall, this highlights the utility of synchronized long-read
              multi-omic profiling for mechanistically resolving complex
              phenotypes. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement J.K., J.G.U.,

  abstract = {There has been tremendous progress in phased genome assembly
              production by combining long-read data with parental information
              or linked-read data. Nevertheless, a typical phased genome
              assembly generated by trio-hifiasm still generates more than 140
              gaps. We perform a detailed analysis of gaps, assembly breaks,
              and misorientations from 182 haploid assemblies obtained from a
              diversity panel of 77 unique human samples. Although trio-based
              approaches using HiFi are the current gold standard,
              chromosome-wide phasing accuracy is comparable when using
              Strand-seq instead of parental data. Importantly, the majority of
              assembly gaps cluster near the largest and most identical repeats
              (including segmental duplications [35.4\%], satellite DNA
              [22.3\%], or regions enriched in GA/AT-rich DNA [27.4\%]).
              Consequently, 1513 protein-coding genes overlap assembly gaps in
              at least one haplotype, and 231 are recurrently disrupted or
              missing from five or more haplotypes. Furthermore, we estimate
              that 6-7 Mbp of DNA are misorientated per haplotype irrespective
              of whether trio-free or trio-based approaches are used. Of these
              misorientations, 81\% correspond to bona fide large inversion
              polymorphisms in the human species, most of which are flanked by
              large segmental duplications. We also identify large-scale
              alignment discontinuities consistent with 11.9 Mbp of deletions
              and 161.4 Mbp of insertions per haploid genome. Although 99\% of
              this variation corresponds to satellite DNA, we identify 230
              regions of euchromatic DNA with frequent expansions and
              contractions, nearly half of which overlap with 197
              protein-coding genes. Such variable and incompletely assembled
              regions are important targets for future algorithmic development
              and pangenome representation.},

              have not been systematically assessed because of the limitations
              of mapping short-read sequencing data1,2. Here we constructed 1:1
              unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs across 102
              human haplotypes and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique
              and duplicated regions3,4. We find that human SNVs are elevated
              60\% in SDs compared to unique regions and estimate that at least
              23\% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC)
              with up to 4.3 megabase pairs of SD sequence converted on average
              per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors
              and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots
              affecting the exons of about 800 protein-coding genes. These
              include 171 genes that have 'relocated' on average 1.61 megabase
              pairs in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent
              framework, we show that SD regions are slightly evolutionarily
              older when compared to unique sequences, probably owing to IGC.
              SNVs in SDs, however, show a distinct mutational spectrum: a
              27.1\% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine
              or the reverse across all triplet contexts and a 7.6\% reduction
              in the frequency of CpG-associated mutations when compared to
              unique DNA. We reason that these distinct mutational properties
              help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA compared
              to that of unique DNA, probably driven by GC-biased conversion
              between paralogous sequences5,6.},
